Question 2

What are the different types of variables in Robot framework, please provide example?

Answer: There are three types of variables in Robot Framework.
The first one is “Scalar variables”, it is a variable that can be stored only one by one data.
Example: 
*** Variables ***
${variable1}    one
${variable2}    two


The second one is “List variables”, it is a variable that can be stored many data. And it has to use “index” for accessing the data you want.
Example: if that page contains text only “Bow”
*** Variables ***
@{variable}    Jane  Noon  Bow

*** Test Cases ***
Verify Bow on this page
	Page Should Contain	@{variable}[2]


The last one is “Dictionary variables”, it is a variable that can be stored many data like a List variables but it has to use “key” for accessing the data you want.
Example: 	
*** Variables ***
&{variable1}	name=Test1	age=25		Sex=Male
&{variable2}	name=Test2	age=30		Sex=Female

*** Test Cases ***
What are the name of variable1 and Sex of variable2
	Log	&{variable1}[name]
	Log	&{variable2}[Sex]
